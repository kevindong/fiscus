# Fiscus

This is the repo for the actual code.

# Setting up dev environment
1. Ensure that you have Node.js installed and updated.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Find the `.env` file on the `#general` channel on Slack, download it, and place the file in the root folder of this repo (the same folder where this README file is located).
5. Run `npm run` to start the web server. It varies to some unknown degree, but generally every time you make a change to the code, you'll need to stop the server and restart it so that you can actually see/use your changes.
